# Simple Games App 

This is yet another project that I've built to understand basics of typescript.

In this project I work with [this free API](https://rapidapi.com/digiwalls/api/free-to-play-games-database) that allowed me to fetch data.

I've recreated some of [Freetogame.com](https://www.freetogame.com/) styles to create basic components, that allowed me to manage some state and display fetched data.

You can test the app [here](https://manchini1337.github.io/games-app/).
